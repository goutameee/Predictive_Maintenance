""" To predict an induction motor's longevity using MATLAB, you can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Collect data

Collect data on various factors that can affect the induction motor's longevity, such as the operating temperature, load, speed, and vibration. This data should be stored in a MATLAB-compatible format, such as a CSV file or a MATLAB data file.

Step 2: Preprocess the data

Preprocess the data by cleaning, normalizing, and scaling it. This can involve removing outliers, converting categorical variables to numerical ones, and scaling continuous variables to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. You can use built-in MATLAB functions for data preprocessing, such as zscore and removeoutliers.

Step 3: Select features

Select the most relevant features for predicting the induction motor's longevity. This can be done using feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), or recursive feature elimination (RFE). You can use built-in MATLAB functions for feature selection, such as corrcoef and pca.

Step 4: Train a machine learning model

Train a machine learning model on the preprocessed and feature-selected data. The choice of machine learning model depends on the type of data and the task at hand. Commonly used models in MATLAB include regression models, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. You can use built-in MATLAB functions for model training, such as fitrlinear and fitrnet.

Step 5: Evaluate the model

Evaluate the performance of the trained model using a holdout dataset or cross-validation. This involves measuring the model's accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and other metrics, and comparing them to a baseline or to other models. You can use built-in MATLAB functions for model evaluation, such as crossval and predict.

Step 6: Deploy the model

Deploy the trained model to predict the induction motor's longevity in real-time. This can involve integrating the model into a software application or a hardware device, and providing an interface for users to input the relevant data and receive the predicted output."""

% Load the data
data = readtable('motor_data.csv');

% Preprocess the data
data = removeoutliers(data);
data{:,2:end} = zscore(data{:,2:end});

% Select features
corr = corrcoef(data{:,2:end});
features = find(abs(corr(1,2:end)) > 0.5);
data = data(:,[1,features+1]);

% Split the data into training and testing sets
cv = cvpartition(size(data,1),'HoldOut',0.3);
idx = cv.test;
dataTrain = data(~idx,:);
dataTest = data(idx,:);

% Train a neural network model
net = fitrnet(dataTrain{:,2:end},dataTrain.Life);

% Evaluate the model
pred = predict(net,dataTest{:,2:end});
mse = mean((pred - dataTest.Life).^2);

% Deploy the model
input_data = [25 2000 100 0.2]; % example input data
output = predict(net,input_data); % predicted output
disp(output); % display the predicted output
